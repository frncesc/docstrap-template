# docstrap-template

This is a reduced version of Terry Weiss' [docstrap](https://github.com/docstrap/docstrap), containing only
the [JSDoc3](https://jsdoc.app/) template, but with updated dependencies.

The aim of this fork is just to avoid security warnings in NPM and GitHub, provinding an updated
version of the original Docstrap template.

For details about the original Docstrap project, see [DOCSTRAP-README.md](./DOCSTRAP-README.md) or
better go to the [real docstrap project](https://github.com/docstrap/docstrap).
